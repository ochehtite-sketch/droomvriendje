Four distinct, themed landing pages now exist: , , , and , each with unique layouts, content, and clickable product links. The backend has been configured and tested with the user's live Mollie API key. Prices for several products have been updated in the mock data source.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested the implementation of a product slider/carousel on the homepage, providing a competitor's site as a design reference. The agent was about to start this task.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. This is a significant UI feature that should be tested for functionality (e.g., navigation, responsiveness) and visual accuracy.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** User verification for the Cadeaubon (Gift Card) payment flow. (PRIORITY: P0)

  **Issues Detail:**
  - **Issue 1:**
     - **Attempted fixes:** In a previous session, a bug in the gift card API endpoint was fixed. The fix was tested via a direct API call but has not been confirmed with an end-to-end user test from the frontend.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**

-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Mollie API
-   **Database:** MongoDB (via )
-   **Styling:** Dynamic and conditional CSS classes, use of design system from an agent.

**key DB schema**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
