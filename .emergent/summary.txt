The styling is done with TailwindCSS and follows a professional layout inspired by the competitor, including trust badges and a detailed, clickable footer.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested to make the website even better than the competition and provided screenshots.

-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, JSX, React Router
-   **Styling:** TailwindCSS
-   **Data:** All data is hardcoded/mocked in a central  file.
-   **Architecture:** Single Page Application (SPA) with multiple routed pages.

**key DB schema**
N/A (No database has been implemented).

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main landing page that requires the hero section redesign.
-   : The single source of truth for all product information, videos, and testimonials.
-   : Contains all the routes for the numerous pages created.
-   : Contains global styles, including the CSS override to hide the Made with Emergent banner.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   The **header and footer** are currently hardcoded into every page component (, , etc.). This creates significant code duplication and makes updates tedious and error-prone. They should be extracted into their own reusable components (e.g., , ) and imported into a main layout component or .

**key api endpoints**
N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly specific about the design and wants it to be a close replica of . They frequently provide feedback and request changes after seeing an implementation.
-   The immediate priority is to **ignore the last premium design** the agent created and implement the simpler hero section on  as per the user's most recent instructions.
-   Always communicate in **Dutch**.
-   The entire application is a frontend-only mock. There is no backend or database.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Requests to make the website even better than the competition, provides screenshots of the competitor.
2.  **User:** Provides a screenshot of the competitor's hero section and specific text, rejecting the agent's premium design. Requests a simpler hero section with a single Bekijk onze knuffels button.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   The  hero section design is not what the user wants and must be changed.
-   **Mocked:**
    -   All website data (products, prices, reviews, videos) is mocked in .
    -   The entire backend, shopping cart, and checkout functionality are non-existent.

**3rd Party Integrations**
None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (Agent used screenshot tool).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** YES (Used logs to find and fix JSX errors).
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not refactor the repetitive header and footer code into reusable components. This has led to a lot of extra work when making global changes like updating the logo or footer information. This should be prioritized as an Upcoming Task.</analysis>
