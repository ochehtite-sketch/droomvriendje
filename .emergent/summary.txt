**what currently exists?**
A full-stack e-commerce application (React + FastAPI + MongoDB) for Droomvriendjes, featuring live payments with Mollie and email notifications via TransIP SMTP. A critical header/footer refactoring has been completed, centralizing this code into reusable , , and a main  component that is now used by most pages. A new, fully-featured landing page has been created at . Seven products now have extensive image galleries populated from Imgur links provided by the user. The primary product images for these products have been updated to remove visual watermarks (BESTSELLER, 50% korting). The site is integrated with Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Removing hardcoded promotional badges (BESTSELLER, POPULAIR, -50% op 2e) from the product cards on . This was the final step in a user request to remove all such visual clutter from product displays across the site.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (via screenshot)

The agent confirmed the code change worked but the screenshot revealed that some product card images on the homepage *still* have the watermarks baked into the image file itself.

-   **User Testing Done:** N

  **Issues Detail:**
  - **Issue 1:**
     - **Attempted fixes:** The agent successfully removed all *coded* badges and overlays from  and . The agent also updated the primary  URL in  for the 7 products that received new galleries. However, other products displayed on the homepage (e.g., Schaap) were not updated and their default  URL still points to an old, watermarked file.
     - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Identify all products in  that appear on the homepage and still have watermarked  URLs.
        2.  For each of these products, update the  field to a clean URL. If a clean URL isn't available in their gallery, use the original  and inform the user.
